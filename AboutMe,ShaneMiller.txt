I am born and raised in Australia. I have a certificate iv in Engineering (electronics) and a certificate iv in Information Technology. I have completed two units at RMIT University so far and am currently continuing my studies through them working towards a Bachelors's in Information Technology. In my spare time, I like to study, play computer games, and to spend time with my chihuahua Daisy.
